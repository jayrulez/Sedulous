	/// to make neighboring fields align cleanly/obviously everywhere. Each vertex position is expected to be at the start address
	/// of the stride range and any excess space is ignored by acceleration structure builds. This excess space might contain other
	/// app data such as vertex attributes, which the app is responsible for manually fetching in shaders, whether it is interleaved
	/// in vertex buffers or elsewhere.
	/// The memory pointed to must be in state D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE.Note that if an app wants to share vertex
	/// buffer inputs between graphics input assembler and raytracing acceleration structure build input, it can always put a resource
	/// into a combination of read states simultaneously,
